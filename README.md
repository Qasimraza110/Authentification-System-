This is a full-stack authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It allows users to sign up, log in, and access a protected dashboard.

Frontend:

AuthContext is used for managing authentication state across the app

React Router is used for navigation between Home, Login, Signup, and Dashboard

Backend:

Built with Node.js + Express.js

Connected to MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose

Includes User model with fields: username, email, password

Password hashing with bcrypt

JWT authentication for login & protected routes

Routes:

/api/auth/register â†’ Register a new user

/api/auth/login â†’ Login existing user

/api/auth/me â†’ Get logged-in user (protected)

Authentication Flow:

User registers with username, email, password

Backend saves user and returns a token
